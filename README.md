You will need to install Node ^8.9.4.

  1. Install Gulp globally by entering `npm install -g gulp` in your terminal.
  1. Navigate to your project's directory via terminal (something like `cd ~/Sites/cleanslate_themes/MY-SITE`)

**Note:** the `gulpfile.js` in its base form will only compile your Sass.

## WVU Design System and CleanSlate

If you are building a theme for [CleanSlate](https://cleanslatecms.wvu.edu/), you can use partials to include [components](https://designsystem.sandbox.wvu.edu/components). These are stored in a global theme called WVU Design System Components. Make sure to reference the this theme if you want to use a global partial. For example, to include a [Hero component](https://designsystem.sandbox.wvu.edu/components/hero), you would use the partial ```<r:partial name="components/wvu-hero" theme="University Relations: WVU Design System" />```. If you donâ€™t want to use a global partial, you can create your own. For more about how to build themes in CleanSlate, check out [https://cleanslatecms.wvu.edu](https://cleanslatecms.wvu.edu).

### Testing for CleanSlate

If you are building a theme for [CleanSlate](https://cleanslatecms.wvu.edu/), test your themes locally using [Hammer VM](https://bitbucket.org/wvudigital/hammer-vm/src/master/).
